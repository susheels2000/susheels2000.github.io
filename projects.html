                I often work on pure mathematics, involving questions in geometry and number theory.
                In my free time, I also explore questions in computer science and its intersections with pure math.
                This section mainly describes such projects that I work on.

                <h4>Algebraic Curve Classifier</h4>
                <p>
                    Machine learning has opened a new angle for approaching problems in pure science.
                    As I was working on a project, I began wondering whether it could be used to understand curves and their properties.
                    Since there is little research in this direction, I decided to start by building a curve classifier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with the relatively simple case of degree 4 curves, using a CNN-based classifier in PyTorch
                    to distinguish between smooth, nodal, and cuspidal curves. Since nodes and cusps are not easily
                    distinguishable at small scales, I generated curves where the tangents at a singularity had noticeable
                    coefficients, and for nodal curves, ensured the angle between tangents was at least arctan(0.3).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two models were trained: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Both achieved strong results — 87.6% and 88.4%
                    accuracy, respectively — with Average Pooling performing ~4% better on nodal curves.
